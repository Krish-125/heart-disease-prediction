# Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.  
The model is built and tested in a **Jupyter Notebook**, using various Python data science libraries.

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, exercise-induced angina, and more.
- The num variable indicates whether a patient is likely to have heart disease (`1`) or not (`0`).

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
